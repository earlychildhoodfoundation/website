            The Caplan Foundation for Early Childhood is an incubator of
            promising research and development projects that appear likely to
            improve the welfare of young children, from infancy through 7 years,
            in the United States. Welfare is broadly defined to include physical
            and mental health, safety, nutrition, education, play, familial
            support, acculturation, societal integration and childcare.
          </p>
          <p class="lede col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
            Grants are only made if a successful project outcome will likely be
            of significant interest to other professionals, within the grantee’s
            field of endeavor, and would have a direct benefit and potential
            national application. The Foundation’s goal is to provide
            <strong>seed money</strong> to implement those imaginative proposals
            that exhibit the greatest chance of improving the lives of young
            children, <strong>on a national scale</strong>. Because of the
            Foundation’s limited funding capability, it seeks to maximize a
            grant's potential impact.

                  <p>
                    Children can only reach their full potential when all
                    aspects of their intellectual, emotional and physical
                    development are optimally supported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Providing a safe and nurturing environment is essential as
                    is imparting the skills of social living in a culturally
                    diverse world. Therefore, the Foundation supports projects
                    that seek to perfect child rearing practices and to identify
                    models that can provide creative, caring environments in
                    which all young children thrive.

                  <p>
                    Research shows that children need to be stimulated as well
                    as nurtured, early in life, if they are to succeed in
                    school, work and life. That preparation relates to every
                    aspect of a child’s development, from birth to age seven,
                    and everywhere a child learns – at home, in childcare
                    settings and in preschool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We seek to improve the quality of both early childhood
                    teaching and learning, through the development of innovative
                    curricula and research based pedagogical standards, as well
                    as the design of imaginative play materials and learning
                    environments.

                Furthermore, the Foundation will only fund grant applications
                that define measurable outcomes, include credible methods for
                documenting and assessing results, provide for financial
                accountability in the application of funds, and include

                The Foundation will not fund arbitrary or excessive allocations
                of indirect expenses even if a project is worthy. The
                Foundation’s Board will only approve a maximum of 15% of a
                project’s direct expenses, when earmarked as general and/or
                administrative overhead.

                <b>incubator of innovative research and development</b> directed
                to improving the general welfare of young children, we will not
                fund more than the first year of multiple year projects. It is
                our belief that having multiple funders, of those worthy
                projects that demand more sustained efforts, increases the
                likelihood of their success by ensuring broader oversight and
                greater long term promotional possibilities.

            This ensures that consideration of Full Proposals is limited to

              There are many proposals that we do not consider because they do
              not meet the criteria stated in our website. We strive to fund
              ideas that are adventurous, thoughtful and challenge the status
              quo. They should have a fresh concept (not rehash an older idea)
              and a defined method of implementation that promotes new
              approaches and understanding of early childhood and pushes the
              boundaries of academic, social and cultural studies and practices.

              <p class="lede-section">
                Frank and Theresa Caplan were pioneers in the development of
                creative, imaginative, educational toys for young children. In
                the early thirties, Frank Caplan was a youth worker and one of
                the first male nursery school teachers in the United States. In
                1949, he co-founded Creative Playthings, a company that designed
                and manufactured toys to enhance the imagination and learning of
                young children.
              </p>

              <p>
                By the 1950’s, Creative Playthings was one of the most important
                manufacturers and suppliers of early childhood educational toys
                and equipment. They collaborated with internationally known
                artists, such as Nino Vitali, to design toys, as well Milton
                Hebald, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Winston and architects like Louis
                Kahn to design outdoor playscapes and sculptures.
              </p>

              <p>
                Creative Playthings researched and developed innovative
                curriculum materials for schools and furniture that could be
                stacked and rearranged to allow for flexibility within the
                classroom. They introduced dolls, which were racially diverse,
                and anatomically correct boy and girl dolls, which were
                provocative at the time.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 1975, Frank Caplan and his wife, Theresa, created The
                Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering
                research and publishing organization focusing on materials for
                parent education. He researched and co-authored, with Theresa, a
                national bestselling series on early childhood development
                called <cite>The First Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1977),
                <cite>The Second Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1978), and
                <cite>The Early Childhood Years: The 2-6 Year Old</cite> (1983).
                In addition, Frank and Theresa co-authored
                <cite>The Power of Play</cite> in 1973.
              </p>

              <p>
                Throughout their lives, Frank and Theresa worked to develop
                innovative and beautifully designed educational toys and
                equipment for home and school environment. They wanted to
                encourage parents’ understanding and knowledge about the
                extraordinary time of infancy and early childhood.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Caplan Foundation for Early Childhood was created in 2014 as
                a result of a bequest from Theresa Caplan stipulating her estate
                be used to incubate innovation and research addressing the needs
                of children from birth through age seven.
