      Frank and Theresa Caplan were pioneers in the development of creative,
      imaginative, educational toys for young children. Throughout their lives, Frank and Theresa worked to develop innovative and
      beautifully designed educational toys and equipment for home and school
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>In the early thirties,
      Frank Caplan was a youth worker and one of the first male nursery school
      teachers in the United States.</p>
    <p>In 1949, he co-founded Creative Playthings,
      a company that designed and manufactured toys to enhance the imagination
      and learning of young children.</p>

    <p>
      By the 1950’s, Creative Playthings was one of the most important
      manufacturers and suppliers of early childhood educational toys and
      equipment. They collaborated with internationally known artists, such as
      Nino Vitali, to design toys, as well Milton Hebald, Isamu Noguchi, Robert
      Winston and architects like Louis Kahn to design outdoor playscapes and
      sculptures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creative Playthings researched and developed innovative curriculum
      materials for schools and furniture that could be stacked and rearranged
      to allow for flexibility within the classroom. They introduced dolls,
      which were racially diverse, and anatomically correct boy and girl dolls,
      which were provocative at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1975, Frank Caplan and his wife, Theresa, created The Princeton Center
      for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering research and publishing
      organization focusing on materials for parent education. They researched and wrote a national bestselling series on early
      childhood development called
      <cite>The First Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1977),
      <cite>The Second Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1978), and
      <cite>The Early Childhood Years: The 2-6 Year Old</cite> (1983). In
      addition, Frank and Theresa co-authored <cite>The Power of Play</cite> in
      1973.
    </p>
    <p>They wanted to encourage parents’ understanding and knowledge
      about the extraordinary time of infancy and early childhood.</p>
    <p>
      The Caplan Foundation for Early Childhood was created in 2014 as a result
      of a bequest from Theresa Caplan stipulating her estate be used to
      incubate innovation and research addressing the needs of children from
      birth through age seven.
