          Application Process
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Foundation employs a two-step grant application process that
          includes the submission of both a Letter of Inquiry (LOI) and a Full
          Proposal–the latter only by those applicants requested to do so. This
          ensures that consideration of Full Proposals is limited to those
          applications that strictly comply with the Foundation’s programmatic
          guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next deadline for submitting a LOI is
          <b>{{ site.nextDeadline }}</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicants must submit Letters of Inquiry by clicking on the
          <i>Email your Letter of Inquiry</i> button below. Once a Letter of
          Inquiry is received by the Foundation, the Directors will determine if
          the proposed program fits the Foundation’s funding guidelines.
          Successful applicants will be invited via email to submit Full
          Proposals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Each Letter of Inquiry should include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol
          class="list-count my-6 rounded-2xl bg-white p-4 text-slate-900 lg:columns-2 dark:bg-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 md:text-2xl  md:font-medium "
        >
          {%- for inclusion in data.inclusions %}
            <li>
              <span
              class="list-count-counter"
              aria-hidden="true"
            ></span>
              <span class="list-count-label">{{ inclusion }}</span>
            </li>
          {%- endfor %}
        </ol>

        <p>
          <mark>
            Your Letter of Inquiry must follow the number format listed
            above.</mark
          >
          Failure to follow the specified format will disqualify your LOI from
          review by the Board of Directors. Please note LOI and the name of your
          organization in the subject line of your email.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many proposals that we do not consider because they do not
          meet the criteria stated in our website. We strive to fund ideas that
          are adventurous, thoughtful and challenge the status quo. They should
          have a fresh concept (not rehash an older idea) and a defined method
          of implementation that promotes new approaches and understanding of
          early childhood and pushes the boundaries of academic, social and
          cultural studies and practices.
