    Frank and Theresa Caplan were pioneers in the development of creative,
    imaginative, educational toys for young children. In the early thirties,
    Frank Caplan was a youth worker and one of the first male nursery school
    teachers in the United States. In 1949, he co-founded Creative Playthings, a
    company that designed and manufactured toys to enhance the imagination and
    learning of young children.

  <p>
    By the 1950’s, Creative Playthings was one of the most important
    manufacturers and suppliers of early childhood educational toys and
    equipment. They collaborated with internationally known artists, such as
    Nino Vitali, to design toys, as well Milton Hebald, Isamu Noguchi, Robert
    Winston and architects like Louis Kahn to design outdoor playscapes and
    sculptures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creative Playthings researched and developed innovative curriculum materials
    for schools and furniture that could be stacked and rearranged to allow for
    flexibility within the classroom. They introduced dolls, which were racially
    diverse, and anatomically correct boy and girl dolls, which were provocative
    at the time.

    In 1975, Frank Caplan and his wife, Theresa, created The Princeton Center
    for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering research and publishing
    organization focusing on materials for parent education. He researched and
    co-authored, with Theresa, a national bestselling series on early childhood
    development called <cite>The First Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1977),
    <cite>The Second Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1978), and
    <cite>The Early Childhood Years: The 2-6 Year Old</cite> (1983). In
    addition, Frank and Theresa co-authored <cite>The Power of Play</cite> in
    1973.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout their lives, Frank and Theresa worked to develop innovative and
    beautifully designed educational toys and equipment for home and school
    environment. They wanted to encourage parents’ understanding and knowledge
    about the extraordinary time of infancy and early childhood.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Caplan Foundation for Early Childhood was created in 2014 as a result of
    a bequest from Theresa Caplan stipulating her estate be used to incubate
    innovation and research addressing the needs of children from birth through
    age seven.
