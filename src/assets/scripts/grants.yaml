      In this environment, they aim to produce robust results with less time-intensive and therefore more cost-effective family nurture intervention by targeting core mechanisms involving emotional and bio-behavioral co-regulation between mothers and children. Furthermore, targeting a parent-child mechanism increases the likelihood that the intervention will be integrated into daily family life outside of treatment. Through FNI, which utilizes the unique relationship between parent and child,
      they seek to establish an emotional connection between parent and child in order to mitigate aberrant behavior.

      Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, IN, has been awarded <strong>$56,240</strong> to support argument-based inquiry, multimodal representations, and young children’s growth in informational text use. ABI is an immersive classroom experience that shifts learning away from rote memorization toward a child’s ability to construct and communicate their own understanding of scientific concepts using language as a tool to ask questions, construct explanations, engage in argument from
      evidence, and obtain, evaluate, and communicate knowledge learned. This project will lead to better understanding how ABI leads to changes in the nature and quality of children’s representations of science knowledge. In turn, these dimensions can be used to predict standardized test performance. The project is expected to identify interactional processes in the classroom that support this learning.

      Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, Tennessee, has been awarded <strong>$46,900</strong> to fund the development and testing of the Playing to Learn (PTL) Curriculum for teaching complex play to young children with disabilities. The purpose of the project is to address and develop an innovative curriculum, PTL. The PTL will support the play skills of young children with disabilities who are known to be at risk for delays in play and be designed to be used by early childhood
      educators regardless of their education and experience—including child care providers, preschool teachers, special educators—in facilitating the play skills in young children with disabilities. The PTL will support the creation of environments that promote the play in children with disabilities including social play with their peers. Given the clear and replicated research highlighting the benefits of play, research should continue to focus on teaching play to children who do not play in
      the same manner as their peers. The PTL curriculum will directly address this need. The PTL curriculum will be of direct benefit to children and early childhood teachers across the nation.

      Nemours / Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, located in Wilmington, DE, has been awarded <strong>$50,003</strong> to fund a project to helping families with children with autism by identifying psychosocial stressors. The Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT) is a brief parent report screener for psychosocial risk in pediatric health. Based on a social ecological framework, it identifies a family’s areas of risk and resilience. Nemours proposes to adapt the instrument for their population
      and to insure its validity and rigorous psychometric properties. This will allow for accurate assessment of risk in families as they receive diagnoses and begin their lifelong paths of accommodation of and adjustment to their affected family member. Nemours will implement more intense and focused monitoring of Targeted families. In the future, after the development of an appropriate and rigorous PAT for their patient population, Nemours will implement its standard use in their clinic. This
      will decrease the likelihood that Targeted families escalate to Clinical/Treatment families. Further, the systematic use of the PAT will lead to increased family satisfaction with care and decreased parental anxiety.

      University of Illinois at Chicago has been awarded <strong>$50,000</strong> to fund the creation of an open access professional development website for child care professionals that centers on early science. The three essential outcomes of the project are to increase child care providers’ knowledge of how to set up environments to enrich and foster science literacy, implement science activities and lessons for children between the ages 0 and 5 years and apply early science concepts that
      are necessary to effectively teach and facilitate scientific learning. In order to meet these outcomes, the Early Science Matters project will include the development of free-access online science resources designed for child care professionals. The project team will continue to build out the site to include more lessons, videos, and development courses that will include the attainment of continuing professional development units for each course completed, and a research project to
      evaluate the efficiency of the courses to prompt positive change in participants knowledge, self-efficacy and confidence about teaching early science in their child care settings and analysis of the site usage and value added for early childhood professionals.

      University of Southern California, located in Los Angeles, CA, has been awarded <strong>$30,000</strong> to support a project titled The Bridge Curriculum. The Bridge Curriculum is a response to a trend in early childhood education where classrooms are directed by worksheets and test scores rather than creative expressions of knowledge and thinking. The Bridge Curriculum will address this problem of practice through the development of a model that includes theory and research-based
      pedagogy and best-practices of play-based instruction. The model serves as a conceptual framework that enables students to utilize both teacher-initiated AND self-initiated play as a means to “traverse” multiple experiences in a variety of content and skill areas. A second problem of practice addressed by The Bridge Curriculum relates to teacher efficacy and capacity regarding play-based instruction in the early grades. Teacher professional development and education related to the
      characteristics of play, learning theory, and child growth and development are integral features of The Bridge Curriculum.

      Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, Tennessee, has been awarded <strong>$40,093</strong> to fund a project titled “Teaching Caregiving Sensitivity through the video Coding of Parent-Child Interactions.” The project will use the funding to support the Stress and Early Adversity (SEA) lab as they develop, pilot, and test an intervention aimed to improve caregiving through the use of video training. They propose that providing real-life examples of parent–child interactions, followed
      by the presentation of how caregiving experts rated each interaction in terms of sensitivity, warmth, and intrusiveness, will provide essential psychoeducation to future caregivers. They hypothesize that by providing these consented video examples of behaviors of real infants and parents and by allowing participants insight into how experts view these interactions, they will be creating a powerful training tool. Further, the promotion of positive caregiving behaviors (e.g., sensitivity,
      warmth) and prevention of caregiving behaviors that are associated with negative outcomes in children (e.g., intrusiveness) may be most effective if delivered prior to the transition to parenthood. Thus, they will plan to pilot this in young adults who are not parents and then to test this in a sample of women during their transition to parenthood.

      Boston Medical Center, located in Boston, MA, has been awarded <strong>$40,000</strong> to fund a project called “Pediatric Practice of the Future.” Their overall goal is to develop a new model of pediatric primary care (the Pediatric Practice of the Future) to better serve children aged 0-5 years. This model will be co-created with families, providers and early childhood community partners, and will be designed to have core components that can be scaled across the country in diverse
      health care settings. The approach uses Human-Centered Design (HCD, a generative, people centered set of design methods that honors the people that they seek to serve; actively engages families, stakeholders, and partners in the design process; and presumes that they will discover together new models, services, experiences, and tools that fall outside the bounds of today’s pediatrics practice.) to drive the process of system redesign and ensure that sustainable system-level improvements
      will be desirable, usable, and accessible to families, pediatric primary care staff, and early childhood community partners.
