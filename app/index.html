								<p>Children can only reach their full potential when all aspects of their development, intellectual, emotional and physical, are optimally supported.  Providing a safe and nurturing environment for infants and preschoolers is essential, as is imparting to them the skills of social living in a culturally diverse world.</p>
								<p>We support programs that research best child rearing practices and identify models that can provide creative, caring environments to ensure all children thrive.</p>

								<h3 class="h3 text-center-lg">Early Childhood Education and Play</h3>
								<p>Research shows that children need to be stimulated as well as nurtured, early in life, if they are to succeed in school, work and life.  That preparation relates to every aspect of a child’s development, from birth to age 7, and everywhere a child learns – at home, in childcare settings and in preschool.</p>
								<p>We seek to improve the quality of both early childhood teaching and learning,  through the development of innovative curricula and research based pedagogical standards, as well as  the design of imaginative play materials and learning environments.</p>

							<p class="lede-section">Frank and Theresa Caplan were pioneers in the development of creative, imaginative, educational toys for young children. In the early thirties, Frank Caplan was a youth worker and one of the first male nursery school teachers in the United States.  In 1949, he co-founded Creative Playthings, a company that designed and manufactured toys to enhance the imagination and learning of young children.</p>

							<p>By the 1950’s, Creative Playthings was one of the most important manufacturers and suppliers of early childhood educational toys and equipment. They collaborated with internationally known artists, such as Nino Vitali, to design toys, as well Milton Hebald, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Winston and architects like Louis Kahn to design outdoor playscapes and sculptures.</p>

							<p>Creative Playthings researched and developed innovative curriculum materials for schools and furniture that could be stacked and rearranged to allow for flexibility within the classroom. They introduced dolls, which were racially diverse, and anatomically correct boy and girl dolls, which were provocative at the time.</p>

							<p>In 1975, Frank Caplan and his wife, Theresa, created The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering research and publishing organization focusing on materials for parent education. He researched and co-authored, with Theresa, a national bestselling series on early childhood development called The First Twelve Months of Life (1977), The Second Twelve Months of Life (1978), and The Early Childhood Years: The 2-6 Year Old (1983). In addition, Frank and Theresa co-authored The Power of Play in 1973.</p>

							<p>Throughout their lives, Frank and Theresa worked to develop innovative and beautifully designed educational toys and equipment for home and school environment. They wanted to encourage parents’ understanding and knowledge about the extraordinary time of infancy and early childhood.</p>

							<p>The Caplan Foundation for Early Childhood was created in 2014 as a result of a bequest from Theresa Caplan stipulating her estate be used to incubate innovation and research addressing the needs of children from birth through age seven.  </p>
