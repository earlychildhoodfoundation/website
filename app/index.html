				<p class="lede col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">Each of its grants is made with the expectation that a successful project outcome will be of significant interest to other investigators or developers, within the grantee’s field of endeavor, and will be amenable to beneficial application or adaptation elsewhere.  In essence, the foundation’s goal is to provide seed money for those imaginative endeavors, addressed to the needs of young children, which appear most likely to bear fruit on a national scale.</p>

				<p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">The Foundation provides funding in the following areas:</p>

								<h3 class="h3 text-center-lg">Early Childhood Welfare</h3>
								<p>Children can only reach their full potential when all aspects of their development, intellectual, emotional and physical, are optimally supported.  Providing a safe and nurturing environment for infants and preschoolers is essential, as is imparting to them the skills of social living in a culturally diverse world.</p>
								<p>We support programs that research best child rearing practices and identify models that can provide creative, caring environments to ensure all children thrive.</p>

								<h3 class="h3 text-center-lg">Early Childhood Education and Play</h3>
								<p>Research shows that children need to be stimulated as well as nurtured, early in life, if they are to succeed in school, work and life.  That preparation relates to every aspect of a child’s development, from birth to age seven, and everywhere a child learns – at home, in childcare settings and in preschool.</p>
								<p>We seek to improve the quality of both early childhood teaching and learning,  through the development of innovative curricula and research based pedagogical standards, as well as  the design of imaginative play materials and learning environments.</p>

									The Bay Area Discovery Museum, located in Sausalito, California, has been awarded a <strong>$50,000</strong> grant to fund the development of the first early childhood education Fab Lab.  Fab Labs began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and have since expanded globally and into middle and high schools.  The early childhood Fab Lab is a novel, model learning environment specifically designed for the youngest children to engage in open-ended activities, pursue individualized interest, and gain familiarity with the next generation of creative tools.  Programs and exhibits will be based on a robust research framework which establishes that children under 5 learn when they are intrinsically motivated, engaged, having fun and active.

A study will be conducted utilizing a modified diagnosis protocol and caregiver-administered treatment to enhance the developmental outcomes of high-risk infants exhibiting developmental delays.  The goals are to conduct an in-depth analysis of the adaptation of an assessment and progress evaluation instrument – currently used to identify and monitor developmental delays in toddlers — for its use with infants as young as 6 months of age; and investigate the extent to which very early initiation of caregiver-implemented behavioral intervention, taught to caregivers using Behavior Skills Training, is therapeutically beneficial for infants born prematurely.

							<p class="lede-section">Frank and Theresa Caplan were pioneers in the development of creative, imaginative, educational toys for young children. In the early thirties, Frank Caplan was a youth worker and one of the first male nursery school teachers in the United States.  In 1949, he co-founded Creative Playthings, a company that designed and manufactured toys to enhance the imagination and learning of young children.</p>

							<p>By the 1950’s, Creative Playthings was one of the most important manufacturers and suppliers of early childhood educational toys and equipment. They collaborated with internationally known artists, such as Nino Vitali, to design toys, as well Milton Hebald, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Winston and architects like Louis Kahn to design outdoor playscapes and sculptures.</p>

							<p>Creative Playthings researched and developed innovative curriculum materials for schools and furniture that could be stacked and rearranged to allow for flexibility within the classroom. They introduced dolls, which were racially diverse, and anatomically correct boy and girl dolls, which were provocative at the time.</p>

							<p>In 1975, Frank Caplan and his wife, Theresa, created The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering research and publishing organization focusing on materials for parent education. He researched and co-authored, with Theresa, a national bestselling series on early childhood development called <cite>The First Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1977), <cite>The Second Twelve Months of Life</cite> (1978), and <cite>The Early Childhood Years: The 2-6 Year Old</cite> (1983). In addition, Frank and Theresa co-authored <cite>The Power of Play</cite> in 1973.</p>

							<p>Throughout their lives, Frank and Theresa worked to develop innovative and beautifully designed educational toys and equipment for home and school environment. They wanted to encourage parents’ understanding and knowledge about the extraordinary time of infancy and early childhood.</p>

							<p>The Caplan Foundation for Early Childhood was created in 2014 as a result of a bequest from Theresa Caplan stipulating her estate be used to incubate innovation and research addressing the needs of children from birth through age seven.  </p>
